# base-converter

A project I did for a class that is a command-line java app that converts numbers between base 2 and 36, supporting very large numbers by using BigInteger. 

## Features
- Supports inputs from command-line arguments or from the interactive prompts
- Validates the base ranges from 2-36
- Handles very large numbers with BigInteger
- Converts number between bases 2-36
